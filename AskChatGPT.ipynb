The company was initially focused on providing enterprise-grade network security products to protect against a new generation of cyber attacks. Their initial products included a firewall, a Virtual Private Network (VPN), and an intrusion prevention system (IPS). In 2012, the company launched its first software-defined networking (SDN) product, which allowed users to easily configure, deploy, and manage their networks.\n",

This purchase allowed Palo Alto to expand its unified networking offerings beyond traditional products to include advanced analytics and monitoring capabilities. Over the next few years, the company acquired other niche security companies, such as Cyvera, LightCyber, and Evident.io, to further bolster its lineup of security products.\n",
